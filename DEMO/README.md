# Block 16: Array Methods

Guided in-class project for Block 16: Array Methods.

In this project we will learn about JavaScript array methods

## Objectives

- Become familiar with with the syntax of array methods and passing in callback functions
- Know how and when to apply the following array methods:
  - filter
  - find
  - forEach
  - map
  - reduce
  - slice

## Introduction

In this project, you will work with a data set summarizing video game sales from 1996-2016. As web developers, you will often work with JSON data to interact with servers, summarize data, get images to your page, and more. It is crucial that you cultivate a thorough understanding of data structures and methods early in your career.

The data set you are given (loaded in at the top of `index.js`) contains a report for each video game sale. Each sale is an object with many keys, including `Name`,`Platform`, `Year_of_Release`, `Genre`,`Publisher`, `User_Score`, and `Global_Sales`. There is a plethora of other data in this set as well, but we won't spend time working with it. You can read more about the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset) or look at the sample object below if you are interested!

Your goal today will be to manipulate the data using array methods and callbacks to create interesting statistics.

### Sample Data
